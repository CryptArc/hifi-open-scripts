# Market Link
This entity script opens the marketplace to a specified item for purchase.

### How to Setup
1. Create an entity that isn't a zone.
2. Install the script in the _Script Url_ and let it run at least once. The script will update the _UserData_ of the object with a Market ID parameter.
3. Update the Market ID parameter in _UserData_ to reflect the desired item you want to address (Example: [https://highfidelity.com/marketplace/items/**d503c1d4-a4f7-41d5-a558-66df60a6b229**](http://highfidelity.com/marketplace/items/d503c1d4-a4f7-41d5-a558-66df60a6b229)).
4. Click or laser trigger the object to double check that the marketplace item entered loads.
5. Done!

### Uses
